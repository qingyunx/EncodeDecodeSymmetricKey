We can see your forgotten Wi-Fi password by running a couple of quick ‘netsh’ commands using Windows Command Prompt.

Step1: Press start and type CMD, right-click on the Command Prompt option shown as a search result and click on Run as administrator.  

Step 2: Type the following command and press Enter to show a list of network names that we connect to.

netsh wlan show profile 

This command list of all wireless network profiles saved on the computer, including their names and settings as shown below. Select the Wi-Fi you want to know its password. 
Lets suppose we want to see password for Wi-Fi Name “Gravity”.

Step 3: Now, type the following command and again press enter

netsh wlan show profile name= "Wi-Fi name" key=clear
This command displays detailed information of that Wi-Fi, including the Profile information, Connectivity settings, Security settings and Cost settings for the specified Wi-Fi network profile.

Step 4: Scroll through the results until we find an entry named Key Content & our Wi-Fi password will be listed next to it.
